This repository contains the code and documentation for my 30-day Android development journey in Kotlin. Over the course of 30 days, I dedicated myself to learning and practicing Android app development using the Kotlin programming language.

## Goals

During the 30-day journey, I set the following goals for myself:

1. Learn the basics of Kotlin programming language and understand its features and benefits for Android development.
2. Gain a solid understanding of the Android app development ecosystem, including the Android SDK, Android Studio, and various development tools.
3. Explore and practice different architectural patterns and design principles commonly used in Android development.
4. Learn to build interactive and user-friendly UI components using XML layouts and Kotlin code.
5. Understand how to interact with external APIs , Firebase & integrate data into Android apps.
6. Develop good coding practices, including code organization, documentation, and version control using Git.
7. Build and publish at least one complete Android app showcasing my learned skills.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into 30 subdirectories, each representing a day of the journey. Each day's directory contains the code, documentation, and any additional resources related to the topic or project for that particular day. The structure is as follows:

```
├── Day 01/
│   ├── Module/
│   ├── Apk/
│   
├── Day 02/
│   ├── Module/
│   ├── Apk/
│  
│   .
│   .
│   .
├── Day 30/
│   ├── Module/
│   ├── Apk/
│  
└── README.md
```

## Module 

Module directory contains the actual application code that is required to be imported or open in android studio.

## Apk

You can directly download the apk in your android mobile and start using it.

## Getting Started

To explore this repository and follow along with my 30-day Android development journey, clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/30-Day-Android-Development
```

You can then navigate to each day's directory to access the Module & apk or that particular day.

## Conclusion

This 30-day Android development project was an intensive learning experience, allowing me to gain hands-on knowledge and improve my skills in Kotlin and Android app development.
